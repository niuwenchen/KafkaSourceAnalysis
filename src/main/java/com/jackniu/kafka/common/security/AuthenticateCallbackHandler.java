     *        the client or broker. Note that these are the Kafka configuration options
     *        and not the JAAS configuration options. JAAS config options may be obtained
     *        from `jaasConfigEntries` for callbacks which obtain some configs from the
     *        JAAS configuration. For configs that may be specified as both Kafka config
     *        as well as JAAS config (e.g. sasl.kerberos.service.name), the configuration
     *        is treated as invalid if conflicting values are provided.
     * @param saslMechanism Negotiated SASL mechanism. For clients, this is the SASL
     *        mechanism configured for the client. For brokers, this is the mechanism
     *        negotiated with the client and is one of the mechanisms enabled on the broker.
     * @param jaasConfigEntries JAAS configuration entries from the JAAS login context.
     *        This list contains a single entry for clients and may contain more than
     *        one entry for brokers if multiple mechanisms are enabled on a listener using
     *        static JAAS configuration where there is no mapping between mechanisms and
     *        login module entries. In this case, callback handlers can use the login module in
     *        `jaasConfigEntries` to identify the entry corresponding to `saslMechanism`.
     *        Alternatively, dynamic JAAS configuration option
     *        {@link } may be
     *        configured on brokers with listener and mechanism prefix, in which case
     *        only the configuration entry corresponding to `saslMechanism` will be provided
     *        in `jaasConfigEntries`.
